start by importing 

import {features} from '../constants';

that will import the words we wanna use, located at constants > index.js i.e 
it's going to be an array of different cards

export const features = [
  {
    id: "feature-1",
    icon: star,
    title: "Rewards",
    content:
      "The best credit cards offer some tantalizing combinations of promotions and prizes",
  },


  import styles, {layout} from'../style';

  it contains some other styles for the section,sectionReverse etc, and if you look at the layout it's simply some additional classNames
  instead of saying flex md:flex-row flex-col ${styles.paddingY in the div clasName 
  we can simply say section and save lot of time


import Button from './Button';


  the button is a component so import it in business div <Button /> 
  then give a margin top of 10 to move down <Button styles="mt-10"/>

  then go to its page to make it 
  to this button we've passed a prop called styles, so we can get that immediately i.e 
  const Button = ( { styles} ) => {

then now make it a button component 
<button type='button'> 

to make the mt-10 work from <Button styles="mt-10"/>
we pass in the prop at const Button = ({ styles }) => {
then in the button className which is dynamic, call it using ${styles} 

for the right side we are going to make a <FeatureCard /> component to make it reusable 
because this component will only be used on this page we can create it above const Business 

const FeatureCard = () => (
  <div className=""></div>
)

lets see which props we will need, 
lets first provide a key since we are mapping over it 
<FeatureCard key={feature.id}/>
and then let's spread the feature properties
<FeatureCard key={feature.id} {...feature}/>
that way it's going to contain all the features that are inside of our feature object
and we can give it an index 
<FeatureCard key={feature.id} {...feature} index={index}/>

when you look at features, we have 
export const features = [
  {
    id: "feature-1",
    icon: star,
    title: "Rewards",
    content:
      "The best credit cards offer some tantalizing combinations of promotions and prizes",
},

let's destructure those from props like this 
const FeatureCard = (icon, title, content, index ) => ( 


so at the top it's 
const FeatureCard = ({icon, title, content, index }) => (
  <div> 
    <div>
      <img src={icon} alt="icon" />
    </div>
  </div>
)

and at the bottom will be 

 {features.map((feature, index) => (
   <FeatureCard key={feature.id} {...feature} index={index}/>
  ))}

you should now see 3 icons show up 


which means we created a reusable component that we are now mapping over


to make padding appear on the bottom of each card but not the last one, add 
${index !== features.length - 1 ? "mb-6" : "mb-0"} inside the className

this class is what added the hovering effect feature-card

so the first div looks like 
 <div className={`flex flex-row p-6 rounded-[20px] ${index !== features.length - 1 ? "mb-6" : "mb-0"} feature-card`}> 

 to put a circle around the icon put a classNmae of 
 className={`w-[64px] h-[64px] rounded-full ${styles.flexCenter} bg-dimBlue `}


 now let's add the text
 under the image div, make a new div 
 for the title first, it will be 
  <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col ml-3"></div>
      <h4>
        {title}
      </h4>
  </div>
