NAVBAR 
Go to Navbar.jsx 

import Hooks i.e import {useState} from 'react' //we have removed react and added {useState}
add 
import {close, logo, menu } from '../assets';
import { navLinks } from '../constants' //to check what these are, hover and ctrl + click 
//navLinks is an array contraining a list of objects that have the id and the title

make a nav,     <nav className='w-full flex py-6 justify-between items-center navbar'>
<img src={logo} />
add alt and class, alt="hoobank" className='w-[124px] h-[32px]'

for the list 
<ul className='list-none sm:flex hidden justify-end items-center flex-1'>





we are going to create a new list only for mobile devices
below ul, we create a new div element
<div className='sm:hidden flex flex-1 items-center'>
then add a menu image, where we can click it to expand the menu

its gonna depend, do we wanna open or close the menu, for that we can create a new use state
go under const Navbar = () => { and create it
const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)
at the start its going to be set to false

go back to image under div
<img src={toggle ? close : menu } />
if the toggle is turned on, then we want to show a close icon, otherwise we want to show a menu icon
once we click it we wanna change the toggle

if you wanna change the state using the previous version of that state, then you need to create a callback function that looks like this
onClick={() => setToggle((prev) => !prev) }/>
so we have setToggle and then you call it prev and then you say not prev, this makes sure react keeps the state up to date

inside this div but below this image, lets create a div thats going to serve as our menu
give it a class, it's going to be dynamic so we wanna check, if toogle is turned on then it's going to be a flex container, if it's not turned on then it's going to be hidden
<div className={`${toggle ? 'flex' : 'hidden'}`}>,  then add some other classes

now we are going to create a new ul, and this ul will be the same as for the large screen, so copy and paste
remove sm in the class because we don't have to use it on small screen
we wanna make it show in a column so we can say flex-col
in the li, change mr-10 to mb-4 to make them aligned
