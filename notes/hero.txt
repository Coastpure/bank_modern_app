go to hero.jsx 
we remove the return statement because we won't need it because we are going to return our jsx instantly
instead of rendering a div, we aree going to render a section of id home, and give it a dynamic classname i.e className={``}>
import some styles 
import styles from '../style'
import { discount, robot } from "../assets";

how to add a space after a span{" "}

to make space between words work, align them with the span i.e 
<span className="text-white">20%</span> Discount For {" "}
<span className="text-white">1 Month</span> Account

dynamic class name is written as 
className={`${styles.flexCenter}, it comes from the style.js file and in this case it is defined in the style file as const styles = { flexCenter: "flex justify-center items-center"};

relative z-[5] to make the robot image appear above the gradient

we can add the gradient by a series of self closing divs


to make get started appear on mobile devices below, make a new div for it 
 <div className={`ss:hidden ${styles.flexCenter}`}>
        <GetStarted />
</div>
ss means it will usually be hidden, then it will show on small screens
