start with npm create vite@latest
instead of create react app
run:  npm run dev
then because we want to use tailwind, check documentation how to do it 
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

run: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
run:npx tailwindcss init -p    //this creates our config files, lets set them up

paste tailwind.config.cjs code from github
paste index.css code from github
delete all code on App.jsx 
type rafce 
delete app.css and assets folder

make new folder in src, name it constants, new file index.js  this is where all the static texts will be
i.e the titles, descriptions, some lists etc, we wanna have have predone lists of links so we can simply map through them
and not spend time time writing it all by hand, paste the index js code here
